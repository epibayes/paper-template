# Before you start writing

Some questions to ask yourself:

1. **What are your personal/professional goals in writing this paper?** Your career stage and level of engagement with the topic can and should dictate the way you approach a paper. Is this the publication you want to showcase when looking for your next job? Is this part of building a research program on your own by testing out new ideas? 

2. **Who is your intended audience?** This could also be described as "what do you want to accomplish with your paper?" Is the goal to showcase some kind of incremental improvement to existing approaches? Push back hard against a mistaken idea? Contribute to policy or public conversation? All of them are valid; you should just have an idea of who you are trying to reach and why?

3. **What is the right outlet for this work?** Do you plan to submit to a broad field journal (AJE, Epidemiology, AJPH), a speciality within a field (e.g. Environmental Health Perspectives, Clinical Infectious Diseases), a methods-focused journal (Statistics in Medicine, Statistical Science), or a general audience journal (PNAS, Nature, Science). This will dictate your style, organization and length. If you are thinking of going for a high-risk/high-reward outlet, think about whether that serves your goals in 1 & 2, also think about if you want to take the time to go through multiple submissions or if you'd rather go for something that is more of a sure thing and keep moving. *It is easy to forget that submitting and resubmitting papers is a lot of work and that a paper in a good but less-prestigious journal can be as or more helpful to you and the field than a super high-profile one.*

# Introduction

1.  **What is the problem your analysis is meant to address or solve?** Use the first paragraph or two of the introduction to outline the scope and importance of the problem you're addressing.
2. **What else has been tried?** This is the part where you get into the approaches that have been taken to this problem and the results that have come out of this. 
	1. No need to be negative in this part: This isn't about why everything else is awful, but just what has already been accomplished, what we've learned from work done before by others (and potentially ourselves).
3. **Nevertheless...** This is where you can identify the gap left by the previous work. For example may fit into one of these example categories:
	1. Previous analyses got at an important question but not with the kind of data you are using, which may be more: detailed, contextually relevant, etc. 
	2. Previous work used a methodological approach that was not able to get at some important dimension of the problem, over/under-stated variability in outcomes, etc.
	3. Earlier work didn't address the broader context of the problem, i.e. too narrowly focused on a specific dataset or place and less on understanding the processes that cut across contexts.
	4. **In this paper we will...** For the love of everything holy, please tell me what you are going to do before you do it. This is the point of departure for your reader on the journey that will be reading and metabolizing your paper: give them a map!
		1. Use this part to mention the data you will use, i.e. where it comes from and what outcomes you are focusing in on.
		2. Also describe the methods in brief - don't get into a ton of depth, but just mention what you're going to do and provide a 1-sentence justification.

# Methods

1. **Introduce the methods and data in broad terms.** Use the first paragraph of the methods section to do a bit more 'signposting', i.e. giving the reader a sense of the reasoning behind the methodological approach and for using a particular dataset to address your particular question.
	1. **This applies even to methods/stats papers:** In most cases, the introduction of the entire paper should be largely focused on the epidemiological or public health problem at hand. If it is a more methods-focused or statistical paper, that may not entirely be the case. But even then, the introduction should be motivating the scientific importance of the method rather than getting into the nuts and bolts of the approach.

## Data

This section can and should be a mit more formulaic than the ones that came before. It really is as much 'just the facts ma'am' as possible. The motivating question in writing this section should be: "What does the reader need to know about the data to understand the results?"

1. **What do the data measure?**
	1. Include outcomes, covariates, etc. If you have multiple sources (e.g. case data + census) introduce both.
2. **When/how were they collected? Who collected the data?** This is what is sounds like: Give a sense of the provenence of the data. If they come from a larger/long-term study, refer to earlier analyses from the study. If a published study protocol exists, be sure to cite it. 
3. **Any important caveats.** Emphasis here is on *important*: What does the reader need to know about what the data *don't* show in order to make sense of the analysis. Don't spend time here getting into nuance - you can do that in the discussion.
