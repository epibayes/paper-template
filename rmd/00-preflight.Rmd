 # Before you start writing

Some questions to ask yourself:

1. **What is the major idea/contribution of the paper?** If you have more than one, you either need to reconsider what your main idea is or think about splitting into two papers. The reason to do this is simple: you have not much space and not much attention from other people and you want to make the most of what you have. Sticking to 'one idea per paper' is in general a good practice to ensure that your message comes through as clearly and impactfully as possible.
2. **What are your personal/professional goals in writing this paper?** Your career stage and level of engagement with the topic can and should dictate the way you approach a paper. Is this the publication you want to showcase when looking for your next job? Is this part of building a research program on your own by testing out new ideas? 
3. **Who is your intended audience?** This could also be described as "what do you want to accomplish with your paper?" Is the goal to showcase some kind of incremental improvement to existing approaches? Push back hard against a mistaken idea? Contribute to policy or public conversation? All of them are valid; you should just have an idea of who you are trying to reach and why?
4. **What is the right outlet for this work?** Do you plan to submit to a broad field journal (AJE, Epidemiology, AJPH), a speciality within a field (e.g. Environmental Health Perspectives, Clinical Infectious Diseases), a methods-focused journal (Statistics in Medicine, Statistical Science), or a general audience journal (PNAS, Nature, Science). This will dictate your style, organization and length. If you are thinking of going for a high-risk/high-reward outlet, think about whether that serves your goals in 1 & 2, also think about if you want to take the time to go through multiple submissions or if you'd rather go for something that is more of a sure thing and keep moving. *It is easy to forget that submitting and resubmitting papers is a lot of work and that a paper in a good but less-prestigious journal can be as or more helpful to you and the field than a super high-profile one.*
